# XAI Research Group at Leiden University

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Research Group at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS), Leiden University. 
Our mission is to enhance the transparency and interpretability of AI and Evolutionary Computing (EC) systems, fostering trust and understanding in AI technologies.

## About Us

Led by Dr. Niki van Stein, our team focuses on developing methods that elucidate AI decision-making processes. Our interdisciplinary research spans various scientific domains and industry applications, including:

- **Explainable Predictive Maintenance**: Creating explainable models to anticipate equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.
- **Heuristic Optimization Analysis**: Investigating the behavior of optimization algorithms to improve their performance and transparency.
- **Novel XAI Methods**: Developing innovative techniques to interpret complex AI systems.
- **Large Language Model driven EC methods**: Developing innovative techniques to use LLMs for automatic algorithm construction.

We collaborate with experts in machine learning, optimization, and domain-specific fields to build effective and user-friendly explainable systems.

## Research Projects

Our current projects include:

- **AI for Oversight**: Developing AI systems that assist in oversight functions across various sectors.
- **XAIPre**: Focusing on explainable AI for predictive maintenance applications.
- **Complex Lens Design Optimization**: Enhancing the design of complex lens systems through optimization techniques.
